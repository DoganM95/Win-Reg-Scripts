My collection of .reg files to change windows behaviour.  
Some scripts may be Win 11 specific and not apply to win 10.

- `AutoLogonCheckbox - Netplwiz`: Brings back the checkbox in netplwiz.exe which is required to enable autologon
- `FoldersFirstWhenGroupingByType - Explorer`: Changes "File Folder" to ".File Folder" in explorer, so folders are shown first, when grouping files by type. Explorer.exe needs to be restarted for this to take effect
- `TaskbarSnapGroups - Explorer`: Disables grouping unrelated windows into taskbar icon hover, e.g. you hover on vscode and it shows one window with chrome next to it... May also disables the task-view (Alt + Tab)
- `FixMissingExecutableIcons - Explorer`: Fix for icons in taskbar and explorer executable icons suddenly gone missing.
