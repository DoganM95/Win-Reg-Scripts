My collection of .reg files to change windows behaviour.  
Some scripts may be Win 11 specific and not apply to win 10.

- `AutoLogonCheckbox - Netplwiz`:  
  - Brings back the checkbox in netplwiz.exe, which is required to enable autologon
- `FoldersFirstWhenGroupingByType - Explorer`:  
  - Changes type "File Folder" to ".File Folder" in explorer, so folders are shown first, when grouping files by type
  - Requires a restart of explorer.exe
- `TaskbarSnapGroups - Explorer`:
  - Disables grouping unrelated programs into one taskbar item
  - Perhaps also disables the task-view (Alt + Tab) as a side effect
- `FixMissingExecutableIcons - Explorer`:
  - Fix for broken executable icons in taskbar and explorer
- `PasswordPromptOnResume`:
  - Removes password prompt when waking the device from sleep
- `ShowFullContextMenuByDefault`:
  - Shows the extended right click by default, as if pressed "show more"
  - Requires a reboot
- `EnableHibernateOption`:
  - Enables the Hibernate option, also in old Control Panel, so it becomes available as lid/button option
  - *Turn on fast start-up* option appears as a side effect
- `OpenWithVscode - Explorer`:
  - A context menu entry to open files/folders with a portable vscode
