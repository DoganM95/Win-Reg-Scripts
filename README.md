My collection of .reg files to change windows behaviour.  
Some scripts may be Win 11 specific and not apply to win 10.

- `AutoLogonCheckbox-Netplwiz`: Brings back the checkbox in netplwiz.exe which is required to enable autologon
- `FoldersFirstWhenGroupingByType - Explorer`: Changes "File Folder" to ".File Folder" in explorer, so folders are shown first, when grouping files by type. Explorer.exe needs to be restartet for this to take effect
