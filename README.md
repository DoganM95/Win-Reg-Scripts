My collection of .reg files to change windows behaviour.  
Some scripts may be Win 11 specific and not apply to win 10.

- `AutoLogonCheckbox - Netplwiz`: Brings back the checkbox in netplwiz.exe which is required to enable autologon.
- `FoldersFirstWhenGroupingByType - Explorer`: Changes "File Folder" to ".File Folder" in explorer, so folders are shown first, when grouping files by type. Explorer.exe needs to be restarted for this to take effect.
- `TaskbarSnapGroups - Explorer`: Disables grouping unrelated windows into taskbar icon hover, e.g. you hover on vscode and it shows one window with chrome next to it... May also disables the task-view (Alt + Tab).
- `FixMissingExecutableIcons - Explorer`: Fix for icons in taskbar and explorer executable icons suddenly gone missing.
- `PasswordPromptOnResume`: Disable to prevent windows from asking you for a password when resuming the pc from sleep.
- `ShowFullContextMenuByDefault`: Makes the right click context menu always show all options, as if you pressed show more.
- `EnableHibernateOption`: Enables the Hibernate option, also in old Control Panel, so it becomes available as lid/button option. A good side effect: the *Turn on fast start-up* option also appears.
